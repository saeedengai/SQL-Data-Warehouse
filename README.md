## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Goal**  
Create a modern data warehouse in **SQL Server** that consolidates sales data to support analytical reporting and informed decisions.

**Specifications**  
- **Data Sources:** Load data from two systems (**ERP** and **CRM**) provided as CSVs.  
- **Data Quality:** Clean and fix quality issues before analysis.  
- **Integration:** Merge both sources into one intuitive, analytics-ready data model.  
- **Scope:** Work with the most recent dataset only; historical storage isn’t required.  
- **Documentation:** Deliver clear documentation of the data model for both business and analytics users.
